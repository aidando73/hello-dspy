The members of the set are called \"symbols\", and are typically thought of as representing letters, characters, or digits. For example, a common alphabet is {0,1}, the binary alphabet, and a binary string is a string drawn from the alphabet {0,1}. An infinite sequence of letters may be constructed from elements of an alphabet as well.»\n",

The appearance of any text in \"column 1\" (or any column) of a line does not change the meaning of that text in a string grammar. A string grammar can be used to describe the structure of some natural languages, such as English or French, as well as for some computer languages.»\n",

The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. A string may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.»\n",
      "[5] «String literal | A string literal or anonymous string is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code of a computer program. Most often in modern languages this is a quoted sequence of characters (formally \"bracketed delimiters\"), as in codice_1, where codice_2 is a string literal with value codice_3 – the quotes are not part of the value, and one must use a method such as escape sequences to avoid the problem of delimiter collision and allow the delimiters themselves to be embedded in a string. However, there are numerous alternate notations for specifying string literals, particularly more complicated cases, and the exact notation depends on the individual programming language in question. Nevertheless, there are some general guidelines that most modern programming languages follow.»\n",
