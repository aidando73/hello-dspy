His weight at the beginning of the workouts is $244$ pounds. How many pounds does he expect to weigh at the end of the ten weeks? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\", 'reasoning': 'Each week, his weight becomes $.99$ times that of the previous week. Therefore, after 10 weeks, his weight is $244 \\\\times (.99)^{10} \\\\approx 220.6$, so the answer is $\\\\boxed{221}$.', 'answer': '221'}) (input_keys={'question'})\n"
