    "instructions": "To classify historic events, I will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. The input event will be tokenized into individual words or subwords, and then passed through a series of filters to extract relevant information, such as the date, location, and type of event. I will use machine learning models to predict the sentiment and intent behind the event, and then classify it based on its characteristics. To ensure accuracy and informative responses, I will provide detailed descriptions of each classification, including the predicted category, confidence level, and any additional relevant information.",
