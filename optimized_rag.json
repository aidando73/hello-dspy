          "How to conditionally do something if a command succeeded or failed Thats exactly what bashs if statement does: if command ; then echo Command succeeded else echo Command failed fi Adding information from comments: you dont need to use the [ ... ] syntax in this case. [ is itself a command, very nearly equivalent to test. Its probably the most common command to use in an if, which can lead to the assumption that its part of the shells syntax. But if you want to test whether a command succeeded or not, use the command itself directly with if, as shown above.",
          "This worked for me: command && echo OK || echo NOK if command succeeds, then echo OK is executed, and since its successful, execution stops there. Otherwise, && is skipped, and echo NOK is executed.",

          "In Bourne-like shells, an if statement typically looks like if command-list1 then command-list2 else command-list3 fi The then clause is executed if the exit code of the command-list1 list of commands is zero. If the exit code is nonzero, then the else clause is executed. command-list1 can be simple or complex. It can, for example, be a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, || or newline. The if conditions shown below are just special cases of command-list1: if [ condition ] [ is another name for the traditional test command. [ \/ test is a standard POSIX utility. All POSIX shells have it builtin (though thats not required by POSIX\u00b2). The test command sets an exit code and the if statement acts accordingly. Typical tests are whether a file exists or one number is equal to another. if [[ condition ]] This is a new upgraded variation on test\u00b9 from ksh that bash, zsh, yash, busybox sh also support. This [[ ... ]] construct also sets an exit code and the if statement acts accordingly. Among its extended features, it can test whether a string matches a wildcard pattern (not in busybox sh). if ((condition)) Another ksh extension that bash and zsh also support. This performs arithmetic. As the result of the arithmetic, an exit code is set and the if statement acts accordingly. It returns an exit code of zero (true) if the result of the arithmetic calculation is nonzero. Like [[...]], this form is not POSIX and therefore not portable. if (command) This runs command in a subshell. When command completes, it sets an exit code and the if statement acts accordingly. A typical reason for using a subshell like this is to limit side-effects of command if command required variable assignments or other changes to the shells environment. Such changes do not remain after the subshell completes. if command command is executed and the if statement acts according to its exit code. \u00b9 though not really a command but a special shell construct with its own separate syntax from that of normal command, and varying significantly between shell implementations \u00b2 POSIX does require that there be a standalone test and [ utilities on the system however, though in the case of [, several Linux distributions have been known to be missing it.",

          "What are similarities and differences between a checksum algorithm and a hash function? A checksum is used to determine if something is the same. If you have download a file, you can never be sure if it got corrupted on the way to your machine. You can use cksum to calculate a checksum (based on CRC-32) of the copy you now have and can then compare it to the checksum the file should have. This is how you check for file integrity. A hash function is used to map data to other data of fixed size. A perfect hash function is injective, so there are no collisions. Every input has one fixed output. A cryptographic hash function is used for verification. With a cryptographic hash function you should to not be able to compute the original input. A very common use case is password hashing. This allows the verification of a password without having to save the password itself. A service provider only saves a hash of a password and is not able to compute the original password. If the database of password hashes gets compromised, an attacker should not be able to compute these passwords as well. This is not the case, because there are strong and weak algorithms for password hashing. You can find more on that on this very site. TL;DR: Checksums are used to compare two pieces of information to check if two parties have exactly the same thing. Hashes are used (in cryptography) to verify something, but this time, deliberately only one party has access to the data that has to be verified, while the other party only has access to the hash.",
          "They are basically the same thing, but checksums tend to be smaller (a few bytes). Integrity Both hash functions and checksums are used to verify the integrity of data. Cryptographic hash functions are hash functions for which a collision is unknown. This is why cryptographic hash functions are used to construct things like a MAC (see below). Information loss Another property of hash functions and checksums is that information gets lost during computation. This must be true if you convert some data to a checksum\/hash with less bits. This is also why you cant go back to the original data with just a checksum or a hash. HMAC What I think you are looking for is a MAC (Message Authentication Code). Such a code is used to detect the tampering of data. Most of the time its just a combination of a hash function and some secret value, like a password. See also: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Message_authentication_code Passwords Passwords are sometimes stored as a hash. To verify the password, a hash is calculated of the password you enter, and it is compared to the stored password hash. Checksums are not used for such things because they are generally shorter and more prone to collisions, meaning that you can try random passwords and have a chance that your input has the same checksum as the original password. But note that using normal (digest) hash functions is not the right way to store passwords. Because they are created for quickly digesting data, attackers can crack those hashes at high speeds. Programmers should use a hash function designed for storing passwords, like bcrypt or Argon2. Edit: examples of algorithms To answer your final question about specific algorithms: Please have a look at the Wikipedia page that lists hash functions. Like I mentioned above, they are basically the same. On Wikipedia, checksums are listed as a subset of hash functions. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_hash_functions",
          "A checksum (such as CRC32) is to prevent accidental changes. If one byte changes, the checksum changes. The checksum is not safe to protect against malicious changes: it is pretty easy to create a file with a particular checksum. A hash function maps some data to other data. It is often used to speed up comparisons or create a hash table. Not all hash functions are secure and the hash does not necessarily changes when the data changes. A cryptographic hash function (such as SHA1) is a checksum that is secure against malicious changes. It is pretty hard to create a file with a specific cryptographic hash. To make things more complicated, cryptographic hash functions are sometimes simply referred to as hash functions.",
          "Let me add two practical examples to the above. Checksums: these are designed to detect accidental changes in data. A great example of this is the checksums used in TCP\/IP. They are simple and very fast (each packet is checked). It is relatively simple to maliciously craft a message whichs checksum equals to that of another. Hashes: these are one-way functions used to map data to a fixed length. They are often used to compare large sets of data without the need to send it over the network. A great example of this is BitTorrent. Once your download finishes, it compares your version of the data to the original by computing the hashes and matching those. What are similarities and differences between a checksum algorithm and a hash function? Similar, they are both deterministic and can map a variable size data to a fixed size. They can both be used to check for sameness, although with different guarantees. See above for differences. Can they be used instead of each other? Or their usage are different? They shouldnt be. See above. For example, for verifying the integrity of a text, which one is better to be used? It depends on what you would like to do. The industry uses both to check for integrity (see examples above). For random error detection, go with checksums To compare large data sets, use hashes For integrity, use HMACs with a cryptographic hash function, like SHA256 For a gentle introduction to data integrity, read this article.",
          "Having a checksum (sum of characters) stored in addition to a hash will weaken the robustness against brute force extremely (especially if not using a short modulus). If this is a problem for you or not, we cant tell. I would advice doing social research studies of that kind when they weaken the security of the system. Just use typical password filters which enforces more differences at password changes and be done."

It highlights that checksums are primarily used for detecting accidental changes in data, while hash functions, especially cryptographic ones, are used for data integrity and security purposes. The context also mentions that checksums are generally shorter and more prone to collisions, making them less suitable for security applications compared to hash functions.",
        "response": "The main differences between a hash and a checksum are as follows: \n\n1. **Purpose**: Checksums are designed to detect accidental changes in data, while hash functions (especially cryptographic hash functions) are used for data integrity and security, ensuring that the original data cannot be easily reconstructed from the hash.\n\n2. **Collision Resistance**: Hash functions, particularly cryptographic ones, are designed to be collision-resistant, meaning it is difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash. In contrast, checksums are more prone to collisions and are not secure against malicious changes.\n\n3. **Size and Complexity**: Checksums are typically smaller and simpler (e.g., CRC32), while hash functions can produce larger and more complex outputs (e.g., SHA256).\n\n4. **Use Cases**: Checksums are often used in applications like TCP\/IP for error detection, while hash functions are used in security applications, such as password hashing and data verification.\n\nIn summary, while both checksums and hash functions serve to verify data integrity, hash functions provide stronger security guarantees and are used in more sensitive applications."
