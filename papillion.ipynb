      "write in Markdown Code:# Investment Research Report ## Introduction China's domestic market for electric vehicles (EVs) has grown rapidly in recent years. With the increasing demand and government support, EV manufacturers have been expanding their portfolios and developing innovative technologies to compete in this emerging market. In this report, we will analyze two leading EV manufacturers in China, Li Auto and XPeng, and present a long-short investment strategy based on our fundamental analysis. ## Executive Summary - We recommend a long position in Li Auto and a short position in XPeng. - Li Auto has a higher revenue and margin than XPeng, indicating better operational efficiency and profitability. - Li Auto has a unique extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) technology that gives it a competitive advantage. - Our valuation analysis suggests that Li Auto is undervalued compared to XPeng. - Political and market risks exist in the EV industry in China, but we believe that Li Auto's strong fundamentals and unique technology can help mitigate these risks. - We also consider the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors in our investment strategy, and Li Auto performs better in this aspect. ## Companies Portfolio | Company | Li Auto | XPeng | | --- | --- | --- | | Founded | 2015 | 2014 | | Headquartered | Beijing, China | Guangzhou, China | | Vehicle Models | Li ONE | G3, P7 | | Market Cap (as of 4/25/2023) | USD 41.8 billion | USD 32.6 billion | | Stock Ticker | LI | XPEV | ## Companies' Fundamental Analysis ### Revenue and Margin - Li Auto's revenue for 2022 is estimated to be USD 9.1 billion, while XPeng's revenue is expected to be USD 7.8 billion. - Li Auto's gross margin for 2022 is estimated to be 18.3%, while XPeng's gross margin is estimated to be 14.7%. - Li Auto's net income margin for 2022 is estimated to be 4.1%, while XPeng's net income margin is estimated to be 2.8%. ### Cash Flow and Interest - Li Auto has positive operating and free cash flows, indicating healthy cash flow management. XPeng has negative operating and free cash flows. - Li Auto's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.03, while XPeng's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.15, indicating that Li Auto has a lower debt burden. ### Technologies - Li Auto has a unique EREV technology that combines an electric motor with a small gasoline engine to extend the vehicle's range, providing a competitive advantage in the EV market. - XPeng has advanced autonomous driving technologies, including a self-developed full-stack system, which could potentially give it a competitive edge in the future. ## Valuation Method We used the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value Li Auto and XPeng. ### Inputs - Discount rate: 10% - Terminal growth rate: 2% - Revenue growth rate (2023-2032): Li Auto 22%, XPeng 25% - Gross margin (2023-2032): Li Auto 18.5%, XPeng 15% - Net income margin (2023-2032): Li Auto 3.5%, XPeng 2.5% - Capital expenditures (2023-2032): Li Auto 10% of revenue, XPeng 12% of revenue - Depreciation and amortization (2023-2032): Li Auto 8% of revenue, XPeng 10% of revenue ### Results - Li Auto's fair value is estimated to be USD 51.8 per share, implying a 30% upside potential from the current price. - XPeng's fair value is estimated to be USD 24.8 per share, implying a 20% downside potential from the current price. ## Risk Factors and Considerations ### Political Risks - The Chinese government's policies and regulations on the EV industry could change, affecting the growth prospects of Li Auto and XPeng. - The geopolitical tensions between China and other countries could also impact the EV industry and the companies' operations. ### Economic Risks - The economic slowdown in China or globally could reduce consumer demand for EVs and affect the companies' revenue and profitability. ### Market Risks - The competition in the EV market is intensifying, and Li Auto and XPeng face competition from established automakers and emerging EV startups. - The potential battery supply shortage could affect the companies' production and sales. ### Considerations - We believe that Li Auto's unique EREV technology and better operational efficiency can help it compete in the market and mitigate the risks. - We also consider the ESG factors, and Li Auto performs better in this aspect than XPeng, indicating better social responsibility. ## Other Reasons to Recommend - Li Auto's focus on quality and safety has earned it a high reputationin the market, which could potentially attract more customers and investors. - Li Auto has a strong research and development team, with a focus on developing cutting-edge technologies to improve its vehicles' performance and safety. - Li Auto has a strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base, which could potentially lead to higher customer retention and word-of-mouth marketing. ## Conclusion Based on our analysis, we recommend a long position in Li Auto and a short position in XPeng. Li Auto's better revenue and margin, unique EREV technology, and undervaluation make it an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, Li Auto's stronger ESG performance and brand recognition add to its potential for long-term growth. While there are political and market risks in the EV industry in China, we believe that Li Auto's strong fundamentals and unique technology can help mitigate these risks.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Margin**: \n",
      "   - Company B's gross margin is estimated at 25%, indicating better cost management or more premium pricing strategies. This could be due to a more established supply chain or higher-value vehicle offerings.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the hypothetical analysis of Company A and Company B, a long position in Company B and a short position in Company A is recommended.
