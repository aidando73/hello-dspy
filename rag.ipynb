In some programming languages and style guides, such as the Allman style, it is common to place opening curly braces on a new line to enhance readability. This can help visually separate blocks of code. In contrast, other styles, like K&R style, place the opening brace on the same line as the control statement, which can save vertical space. Ultimately, whether curly braces should appear on their own line depends on the coding standards being followed in a particular project or organization.',\n",
