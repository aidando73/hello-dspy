This means that at the end of each week, he will weigh $99\\\\%$ of his weight from the previous week. \\n\\nWe can express this mathematically. If his initial weight is $W_0 = 244$ pounds, then his weight at the end of week $n$ can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nW_n = W_{n-1} \\\\times 0.99\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis can be simplified to:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nW_n = W_0 \\\\times (0.99)^n\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFor $n = 10$ weeks, we have:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nW_{10} = 244 \\\\times (0.99)^{10}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNow we calculate $(0.99)^{10}$:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(0.99)^{10} \\\\approx 0.904382\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNow we can calculate Cal O'Ree's weight after 10 weeks:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nW_{10} \\\\approx 244 \\\\times 0.904382 \\\\approx 220.5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nRounding to the nearest whole number, Cal O'Ree can expect to weigh approximately $221$ pounds at the end of the ten weeks.\",\n",
